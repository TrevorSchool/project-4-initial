This was a very quick project to complete and I feel like I spent more time reviewing collections, generics and the iterable interface
than I did on this project. The only Prompting Issue I had was forgetting to declare the package name, but that was an easy fix that
didn't require another prompt to be made. The Bag class was very short, but the BagTest class was longer, so I spent more time analyzing
the test code than the container class. Prompting went smoothly, being clear with the intentions and requirements of what I needed it to 
make ensured I at least received what I was expecting for my project.
